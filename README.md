# CODECRAFT_DS_05
This repository contains my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at CodeCraft Infotech. The main objective of this task was to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and other contributing factors.

# ğŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the [U.S. Accidents (EDA) dataset](RTA Dataset.csv) from Kaggle. It includes information about over 2.8 million traffic accidents in the United States, covering attributes such as location, time, weather conditions, visibility, and severity.

# ğŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
ğŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook

ğŸ”¹ Pandas & NumPy

ğŸ”¹ Matplotlib & Seaborn

ğŸ”¹ Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

ğŸ”¹ Folium (for geospatial hotspot mapping)

ğŸ”¹ Scikit-learn

ğŸ”¹ Datetime & Geopy

# ğŸ§ª Task Objectives
Load and preprocess the accident dataset

Handle missing values and convert datatypes

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze accidents based on:

Weather conditions

Time of day and day of the week

Road conditions and visibility

Visualize accident hotspots using geospatial mapping tools

Identify key factors contributing to accident severity

# ğŸ“ˆ Key Highlights
ğŸ”¹ Cleaned and preprocessed a large, real-world dataset with over 2 million records

ğŸ”¹ Analyzed how weather, visibility, and time affect accident frequency and severity

ğŸ”¹ Visualized accident density across U.S. states using Folium and heatmaps

ğŸ”¹ Discovered peak accident hours, days, and seasonal trends

ğŸ”¹ Identified most common environmental and road-related risk factors


# ğŸ§¾ Conclusion
This task showcased how data science techniques can help uncover insightful patterns in traffic accidents. Through EDA and visualization, we identified high-risk conditions and timeframes, which can inform traffic safety policies and preventive measures.
